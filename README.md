# Production Management Project
This project is about managing the entire stock of different products. Firstly, if the operator wants to modify anything about the stock, he has to log in with an account that already exists in the XML file named "utilizatori". After the validation, the operator can easily add or remove products from the stock.
Every product has a manufacturing batch, that can be added when logged in and of course it is possible to create consumption reports for each product that exists.
For both admins and guests, the interface contains buttons for:
- Visualizing the products that have been added since then, taking all the information from a database;
- Saving the products into a .txt file;
- Printing the products into a .pdf file;
- A graphic interpretation of the products is shown automatically when the user uses the "Visualize products" button.
  It is ready to use and can be utilized for any objects, at the user's choice.
